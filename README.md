## Usage
Just open this [link](https://fathonix.github.io/bios),
loading the emulator should only take a few seconds to a minute.

This web shows v2.00 by default. To show v1.10, add `?bios=us1` to the URL.\
Pass `sound=off` to the URL to completely disable sound.\
Both can be passed simultaneously, delimited by `&` like `?bios=us1&sound=off`.

Pressing F9 toggles audio mute. (doesn't affect when `sound=off` is set)\
F10 resets the emulator.
